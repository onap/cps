      "message": "I wondering about being able to set CPS_HOST to any host (different from localhost) and having management hardcoded to localhost. This will not work is CPS_HOST is not set to localhost,\n\nEither management url should use the same host has CPS_HOST and only the port is different or CPS_HOST should be hardcoded to localhost too is there is no need for another host than localhost.\n\nWhat I mean is that features endpoints and mananagement endpoints should be both consistent using the same host.",
