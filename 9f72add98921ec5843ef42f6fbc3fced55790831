      "message": "Priyank left previous comment about splitting SDNC and PNFsim into a different docker-compose file to avoid polluting this file. I disagree on a few grounds:\n- SDNC is a *direct* dependency of ONAP DMI Plugin. It is very hard to troubleshoot issues without being able to run the components together. Splitting SDNC from DMI Plugin makes no sense to me.\n- There are many components other here like jaeger-gui, kafka-ui, grafana, etc. which are not directly needed, and yet they do not pollute the main file?\n\nWe can discuss further with the team to agree a solution, but I prefer having everything docker-related in the main file, or at least in docker-compose folder.",
