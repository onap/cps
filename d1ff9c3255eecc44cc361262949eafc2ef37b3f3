      "message": "Hey Shivani, I don\u0027t know really what strategy you used while rebasing your commit, but it seems wasn\u0027t right steps! you could have been using only these two while rebasing your commit:\n\n# Clean rebase against current master\ngit fetch origin\ngit rebase origin/master\n\nI know the file you changed only is CmSubscriptionSpec.groovy.\n\nI suggest raising a fresh commit from tha latest origin/master or try to rebase your patchset properly so that your file should only be available for review.\n\n\nI did a recheck your commit, since your current patchset does not work on my local machine. Your all delete integration tests are failigin.\n\nWhat other colleagues think or suggest?",
