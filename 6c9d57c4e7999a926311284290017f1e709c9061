      "message": "there seems to be a lot of overlap with the previous test class.\n In general follow the testing pyramid principle!\nThis class is really a traditional unit tets ie only test one class and you have cover all possible variations here which is the correct way and probably needed because of the possible combinations of files and files in a zip file.\n\nHoever that means you can reduce the test and/or level of assert in the previous test class which was more like an \u0027integration type test. Ie there you don\u0027t have to cover all the variations you cover here. If the integration test calls the same methods you have tested here and there is no different code path depending on the result you can reduce the number of test in the previous class. There is a long term maintenance cost associated with this and in big projects eventually tets runtime an be an become an issue too.\n\nTIP: I use run with code coverage to help me decide what test I need to add in the integration test. Rune a tets and check which path you cover/don\u0027t cover to decide exactly what needs to be added (or can be removed)\n\n(it is not the only factor sometimes additional tets are need to clearly describe behavior even if they do cover the same path...",
