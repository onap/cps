      "message": "is more or less what I suspected... well done\nThe bigger problem is though that we had no test that detected the fault!\nAs we discussed we might need a stricter assert on one of the existing test and/or maybe we need to make sure we test with more than 1 (common/new)  module and verify the number of modules saved... \nBasically the new/improved test should FAIL if you comment out the fix in this patch.\nThis can be handled in a separate commit so our client can progress quickly and take this fix without further delay",
