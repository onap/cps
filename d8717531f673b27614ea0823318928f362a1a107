We shouldnt be impacting anything in their deployment. Also we dont know how this change will behave in their environment.\n\nSo we can have have a flag and exposed as env variable. defaults to false.\nwe can enable in our docker compose deployment for our envs.\nothers can choose to ignore this change.\n\nwhat do you guys think ?",
