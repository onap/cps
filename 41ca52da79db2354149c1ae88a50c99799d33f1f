      "message": "Nb. This will likely give worse performance when using alternate Id now. Assuming we have an alternateId:\n- first we try get YangModelCmHandle by id on line 285, which fails\n- then we resolve the reference using getResolvedCmHandleId() which\n  - tries to look up Cm handle by id, which fails again\n  - tries to look up Cm handle by alternate-id, which succeeds and returns id\n- get the YangModelCmHandle by resolved id\n\nSo this patch optimizes for Cm Handle ID - doing it in a single DB lookup, while it takes 4 DB lookups to resolve alternate ID!\n\nI am investigating alternatives as part of CPS-2511",
