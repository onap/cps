      "message": "CPSException is mapped to HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR (500) in CpsRestExceptionHandler.\n\nIt implies that a client providing an anchor name that is already existing will receive a 500 Internal Server Error response. For more relevant feedback to the client, it seems to me that he should receive BAD_REQUEST (400) in this case, as no error occurred from an internal server processing point of view.\n\n* Should we throw DataValidationException here instead of CpsException ?\n\n* Should we throw CPSAdminException or another subclass of this one ?",
