CPS Scheduled Processes

Introduction
============

The following section is a list of the current scheduled processes running within the CPS system.

Module Synchronization
----------------------
The module sync is a user :ref:`configurable timed process<configuration-properties>`,
which is set to search for CM Handles within CPS with an *'ADVISED'* state.
Once the CM Handle is processed by the module sync, the CM Handle state is then set to *'READY'*, if the process completes successfully.
If for any reason the module sync fails, the CM Handle state will then be set to *'LOCKED'*,
and the reason for the lock will also be stored within CPS.
CM Handles in the *'LOCKED'* state will be retried when the system has availability. CM Handles in a *'LOCKED'*
state are processed by the retry mechanism, by setting CM Handle state back to *'ADVISED'* so the next sync cycle will process those again.

Data Synchronization
--------------------
The data sync is a user :ref:`configurable timed process<configuration-properties>`,
which is set to search for CM Handles with a sync state of *'UNSYNCHRONIZED'*.
Once the CM Handle(s) with a sync state of *'UNSYNCHRONIZED'* is processed by the data sync,
the CM Handle sync state is then set to *'SYNCHRONIZED'*, if the process completes successfully.
If the data sync fails, the CM Handle sync state will remain as *'UNSYNCHRONIZED'*, and will be re-attempted.

Once the data is synched then the data can be retrieved using the OPERATIONAL datastore directly from the CPS database.
