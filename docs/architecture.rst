High Level Component Definition and Architectural Relationships
===============================================================

The Configuration Persistence Service (CPS) provides storage for run-time configuration and operational
parameters that need to be used by ONAP.

In this release CPS is no longer a stand alone component and is released along with Cps-Temporal and the NCMP-DMI Plugin.

Project page describing eventual scope and ambition is here:
`Configuration Persistence Service Project <https://wiki.onap.org/display/DW/Configuration+Persistence+Service+Project>`_

This page reflects the state for Istanbul-R9 release.
