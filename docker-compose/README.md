# Building and Running CPS Locally

## Building Java Archive only

Following command builds all Java components to `cps-application/target/cps-application-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.jar` JAR file
without generating any docker images:

```bash
mvn clean install -Pcps-docker -Pncmp-docker -Pcps-ncmp-docker -Djib.skip
```

## Building Java Archive and Docker Images

* Following command builds the JAR file and also generates the Docker image for all CPS components:

```bash
mvn clean install -Pcps-docker -Pncmp-docker -Pcps-ncmp-docker
```

* Following command builds the JAR file and generates the Docker image for specified CPS component:
  (with `<docker-profile>` being one of `cps-docker`, `ncmp-docker` or `cps-ncmp-docker`):

```bash
mvn clean install -P<docker-profile>
```

## Running Docker Containers

`docker-compose/docker-compose.yml` contains the base services required to run CPS and NCMP.
This deployment can also be used for KPI test. Please run the following command from `docker-compose` folder:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
or
docker-compose --profile tracing up -d
```

`docker-compose/dmi-services.yml` contains the DMI services including SDNC and PNF Simulator.
This deployment is required for the CSIT test.
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f dmi-services.yml up -d
```

To deploy services that are required for Endurance test, please use the following command:
```bash
docker-compose --project-name endurance --env-file env/endurance.env up -d
```

To stop any deployment, please replace `up -d` flag with `down` in the above commands.

### Running from Jar Archive

Following command starts the application using JAR file:

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost DB_USERNAME=cps DB_PASSWORD=cps \
  DMI_USERNAME=cpsuser DMI_PASSWORD=cpsr0cks! \
  java -jar cps-application/target/cps-application-x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Running from IntelliJ IDE

Here are the steps to run or debug the application from Intellij:

1. Enable the desired maven profile form Maven Tool Window
2. Run a configuration from `Run -> Edit configurations` with following settings:
   * `Environment variables`: `DB_HOST=localhost;DB_USERNAME=cps;DB_PASSWORD=cps
                                DMI_USERNAME=cpsuser DMI_PASSWORD=cpsr0cks!`

## Accessing services

Swagger UI and Open API specifications are available to discover service endpoints and send requests.

* `http://localhost:<port-number>/swagger-ui.html`
* `http://localhost:<port-number>/api-docs/cps-core/openapi.yaml`
* `http://localhost:<port-number>/api-docs/cps-ncmp/openapi.yaml`
* `http://localhost:<port-number>/api-docs/cps-ncmp/openapi-inventory.yaml`

with <port-number> is being either `8080` if running the plain Java build or retrieved using following command
if running from `docker-compose`:

```bash
docker inspect \
  --format='{{range $p, $conf := .NetworkSettings.Ports}} {{$p}} -> {{(index $conf 0).HostPort}} {{end}}' \
  <cps-docker-container>
```

Enjoy CPS!
