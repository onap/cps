      "message": "A couple of thoughts:\n- when restarting with an existing DB, the dataspace will already exist, so no exceptions are expected.\n- for DataspaceNotFound, then there would be no CM-handles anyway, so counters should be initialized to zero.\n- so your above solution should work fine. Maybe do some manual testing to verify.\n\nI think another option would be for this class to extend _ApplicationListener\u003cApplicationReadyEvent\u003e_. Since inventory model is created during startup (_ApplicationStartedEvent_), needed model would be available before the application is ready.",
