      "message": "I would see the development process in a different way.\n\nIn early dev cycle steps, in my local env, I don\u0027t want mvn clean package to build any docker image (it requires docker to run, takes more time to build, fills my local file system, ...). This stage requiring repetitive tasks should be straightforward, simple, fast, and light.\n\nLater on in the dev cycle, at integration steps, docker images are required. Also, automatic pipelines to run integration tests are responsible to run appropriate command to build docker images, they will run tests against.\n\nI can not say for CSIT specifically as I\u0027m not familiar with it.",
