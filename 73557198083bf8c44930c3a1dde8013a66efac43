      "message": "In this test class, we were referring base path in three ways\n\n1. deprecatedDataNodeBaseEndPoint \u003d $basePath/v1 -\u003e old endpoints.\n2. ncmpDmiEndpoint \u003d $basePath/ncmp-dmi/v1 -\u003e only dmi registration because the endpoint was not different from others. After the change both deprecatedDataNodeBaseEndPoint and ncmpDmiEndpoint are same.\n3. basePath \u003d  $basePath -\u003e in the passthrough endpoint test cases.\n\nWith the new api change, we can use the same path for all three and I believe it is an improvement over what we had before.",
