      "message": "no a schema is not required as this handles the response in case of a write operation. So, when we post some data to be written to database usually nothing is returned in response body.\nAs per my understanding, since Created response was set to \"text/plain\" while other scenarios like BadRequest, Unauthorized, etc were set to \"application/json\", it was causing a conflict as to what the proper response format should be and hence it fell back to response code 500 as a default.\nAnd you can see that for the delta feature where we have a POST operation the response used is OK instead of Created because there, we return the delta report and OK response uses \"application/json\" which is consistent with other responses.",
