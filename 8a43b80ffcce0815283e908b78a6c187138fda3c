      "message": "now that you had mentioned it, I realized it was unnecessary. Because buildDataNodesWithYangResourceXpathAndNodeData first called CpsPathUtil.getNormalizedParentXpath(xpath) then it called buildDataNodesWithYangResourceParentXpathAndNodeData where I called CpsPathUtil.getNormalizedXpath(parentNodeXpath) again. And just to handle this the following check was needed.\nBut now since the logic is more granular, I was further able to simplify the code, and this complex check is not required. We just need to check if it\u0027s root node xpath or not.",
