Never bene keen on that it so \u0027flexible\u0027 :-) \nIts is testware too, so maybe we need to allow ourselves to set different standard then for Java Production code...\nIt might be useful to do a team walktrough first and in that meeting also agree on how strict we are going to review this we simply cannot apply the same rules as for Java code...",

      "message": "I think in this mixed-load test you aim to run different scenarios concurrently.\n\nHowever, in this setup, seems you run them sequentially by using executor: \u0027constant-vus\u0027. As per documentation, the executor should be a type of: executor: \u0027shared-iterations\u0027 for a scenario e.g. 50 VUs for passthrough_read and 25 VUs for id_search_modue, and 25 VUs for cm_search_module.\n\nI suggest to have a look at \u0027Distribute workloads across VUs\u0027 from official web site docs: https://grafana.com/docs/k6/latest/examples/distribute-workloads/",
