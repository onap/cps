      "message": "this method is also test uniqueness, it is important to show that in the name\ne.g. isValidUniqueSubscriptionId\n\nBut to be honest I think test for valid naming (correct characters etc) should be separate from tets for UNIQUE you probably need to report different errors for each case!\nFinally I don\u0027t understand why you check the CPS Path heer, is the end user creating a CPS path or is it hardcoded in NCMP I would assume the latter and then you dont need to check the CPS Path (but only the ID itself, do we have any agreement/limitation on what the ID can be ?!)",
