Although they are actually different certs in the ZIP:\n- Basically there is 2-way TLS here, where both server and client need to authenticate, so they each need to have certs signed by the CA (certificate authority).\n- PNF Sim is the RestConf server, which has a server cert and key, as well as a CA cert to validate incoming client requests.\n- SDNC is the RestConf client, which has a different cert and key, signed by CA.",
