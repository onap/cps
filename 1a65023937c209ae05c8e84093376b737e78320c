The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password. For example, to authorize as demo / p@55w0rd the client would send\n\nAuthorization: Basic ZGVtbzpwQDU1dzByZA\u003d\u003d\n\nWhat \"username:password\" are we using here for authorizing NCMP to CPS Proxy API ?\n\n2. How are we handling 401 “Unauthorized” response returned for requests with missing or incorrect credentials ?",
